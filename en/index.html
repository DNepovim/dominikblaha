        I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/blahadominik" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://github.com/DNepovim/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/dnepovim" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.<br />
        And I also have a good old <a href="../cvDominikBlaha2024En.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>.

      <p>This is the fast version of my website. The slow one is <a href="../lazy.html">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>I create websites...</h2>
        <p>... and even though it might not look like it, I know CSS as well as HTML.</p>

        <p>For example, for:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://godot.skauting.cz/" target="_blank" title="ČLK Godot">a scout course I co-founded</a>,
            </li>
            <li>
              or for <a href="https://veronica.skauting.cz/" target="_blank" title="LK Veronica">another scout course led by my wife</a>,
            </li>
            <li>
              but I also lead <a href="https://kurzpecka.cz/" target="_blank" title="Kurz Pecka">a course, only evangelical</a>, and I made its website too,
            </li>
            <li>
              my wife plays in <a href="https://jaksisaxy.cz" target="_blank" title="Jaksi saxy (guess which one is my wife)">a saxophone quartet</a>, which also needed a website,
            </li>
            <li>
              I play in <a href="https://kongruence.cz" target="_blank" title="Kongruence">a folk band</a> that doesn't need a website but has one,
            </li>
            <li>
              but the one that really needs a website is <a href="https://praha.skauting.cz" target="_blank" title="Kraj Praha">the Prague Scout Region</a>,
            </li>
            <li>
              and it's also useful for <a href="https://terapieklement.cz" target="_blank">my friend the psychotherapist</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The best website I've made is the one you're on.<br/>
          It's perfectly fast, responsive, and semantic.<br/>
          And say what you will, it's beautiful!

        <h2>And I write...</h2>
        <p>
          ... for a scout magazine.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, about:
          <ul>
            <li>
              how and why <a href="https://casopis.skauting.cz/skauting-jako-vychova-k-sebevedomi-7766" target="_blank">to raise children to be confident in a scout group</a>,
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              and about <a href="https://casopis.skauting.cz/jak-je-dulezite-byt-si-vedom-sve-motivace-pro-dobrovolnickou-praci-8435" target="_blank">why it’s important to understand your motivation for volunteer work</a>.

        <h2>I also lead people...</h2>
        <p>
          ...although no one pays me for it, I've been doing it most of my life.<br />
          At thirteen, I became a <strong>patrol leader</strong>, at nineteen I started leading my <strong>first group</strong>, and at twenty-four, after a short break, my <strong>second group</strong>.<br />
          At that time, I also started leading the <strong>National Youth Committee</strong> of the Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren.<br />
          I also led a team for three years that organized <strong>a regional scout meeting</strong>. I had a lot on my plate.<br />
          Now I lead <strong><a href="https://www.kurzpecka.cz" target="_blank">a course for youth workers</a></strong> in the ECCB, which I founded, and I co-lead my home <strong><a href="https://www.strelka.cz" target="_blank">scout center</a></strong> in Kralupy nad Vltavou.

        <h2>Besides that, I study...</h2>
        <p><a href="https://pvsps.cz" target="_blank">The Prague College of Psychosocial Studies</a>. I am most interested in Jung's <strong>analytical psychotherapy</strong>,<br />but I am also drawn to <strong>Logotherapy</strong> by Viktor Frankl and <strong>client-centered therapy</strong> by Carl Rogers.</p>

        <h2>I have a guitar...</h2>
        <p>
          ... and it's a nice guitar.
